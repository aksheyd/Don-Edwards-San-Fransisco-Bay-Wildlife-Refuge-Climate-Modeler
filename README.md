Michigan EcoData: Don Edwards San Fransisco Bay Wildlife Refuge Climate Modeler
===============================================================================
By Akshey Deokule <aksheyd@umich.edu>

# Introduction
###### This project is a Climate Modeler for the DESFB, a wildlife refuge 5 minutes away from my home in Fremont, CA which I frequent, using US Wildlife & Refuge data on the park's numerous species. I used C++ for the user environment and Python (Pandas) for the data analysis, sorting, and calculations of the danger level of species depending on the climate variables given.

# Get Started
###### Disclaimer: This project is *NOT* intended to be heavily scientific. The calculations done on the ecosystem's survivability are loosely based on scientific articles and journals (even some Wikipedia). The source for the dataset of the flora and fauna can be found at https://fws.gov/refuge/Don_Edwards_San_Francisco_Bay/ 
#### *Requires Python 3 and C++*

```console 
$ make main.exe
$ ./main.exe
```
